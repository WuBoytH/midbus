# mega charizard x fire
 For use with Nanobuds' Mega Charizard X mod for Smash Ultimate

Regardless of the slot you put Mega Charizard X on, the fire effects should only show up on that slot with this plugin.

The Fire effect is recolored as best as I could, as we cannot add entries to .eff files. If .eff editing ever becomes a thing, I will update this plugin.
